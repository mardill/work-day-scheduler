This code creates an editable calendar for the work day. Core working hours appear with editable text boxes to save a schedule throughout the day. The user is able to save their text in the text area using the save button on the right. When the page is reloaded, the schedule will remain.

When the user wants to remove any items they completed or want to change, they can simply delete the text and click the save button again.
